# Module 1: Intro to IT

## Topics Covered
- How computers process information using the **binary system**.
- Converting between **decimal (base-10)** and **binary (base-2)** numbers.
- Understanding **character encoding** (ASCII, Unicode).
- Core concepts like abstraction, algorithms, and cryptography.
- The social concept of the **digital divide**.

## Key Notes
- **Binary System**: Only uses 0 and 1. Each digit is a "bit." 8 bits = 1 byte.
- **Counting in Binary**: Each place represents a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, …).
- **Character Encoding**: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., ASCII: 65 = "A").
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems into manageable layers.
- **Algorithm**: A set of steps or rules to solve a problem.
- **Cryptography**: Securing data through encryption and decryption.
- **Digital Divide**: Gap between those with/without access to technology.

## Glossary
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity by using simplified models.
- **Algorithm**: Step-by-step process to perform a task or solve a problem.
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**: Early character encoding standard (0–127).
- **Binary System**: Base-2 numbering system, foundation of computing.
- **Byte**: 8 bits, used to represent a character or small unit of data.
- **Character Encoding**: Translating numbers into text characters.
- **Computer**: A machine that processes data via instructions.
- **Cryptography**: Practice of securing information with codes.
- **Decimal (Base-10)**: Standard human counting system (0–9).
- **Digital Divide**: Inequality in access to computers and the internet.
