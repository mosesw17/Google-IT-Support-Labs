# Module 1 Notes: Introduction to IT

## Binary System
- Computers use the binary system (base 2) to store and process data.
- Only 0s and 1s are used.
- Example conversions:

| Decimal | Binary |
|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0000   |
| 1       | 0001   |
| 2       | 0010   |
| 5       | 0101   |
| 10      | 1010   |

- Binary arithmetic basics:
  - 0 + 0 = 0  
  - 0 + 1 = 1  
  - 1 + 1 = 10 (carry over)

## Character Encoding
- Computers store characters as numbers using character encoding systems.
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding system.

Example:

| Character | ASCII Decimal | ASCII Binary |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| A         | 65            | 01000001     |
| a         | 97            | 01100001     |
| 0         | 48            | 00110000     |

## Glossary Terms
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on important details.
- **Algorithm**: Step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.
- **Byte**: 8 bits of data.
- **Computer**: A machine that processes data using instructions.
- **Cryptography**: Securing data through encoding/encryption.
- **Decimal System (Base 10)**: Standard number system using digits 0–9.
- **Digital Divide**: Gap between those with and without access to technology.

## Labs & Exercises
1. Decimal ↔ Binary Conversion  
   Example: Convert decimal 13 → binary  
   - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1  
   - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0  
   - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1  
   - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1  
   - Binary = 1101

2. ASCII Conversion  
   - Character 'C' → ASCII decimal 67 → Binary 01000011

3. Practice Exercise  
   - Pick 5 random letters/numbers and write their binary and ASCII equivalents.
