# Module 2: Computer Hardware  

This module covers the fundamentals of computer hardware, including identifying internal components, assembling a computer, and troubleshooting issues.  

## Topics Covered
- Motherboards, CPUs, and RAM  
- Storage devices (HDDs, SSDs)  
- Power supplies  
- Chipsets (Northbridge and Southbridge)  
- Memory types (DRAM, SRAM, DIMMs)  
- Power supply form factors  
- Assembling a computer from individual components  

## Labs & Projects
- Identified internal computer parts and their functions  
- Distinguished storage types and memory modules  
- Reviewed motherboard layouts and chipset functions  
- **PC Assembly Project**: Successfully installed the power supply, CPU, thermal paste, heat sink & CPU fan, RAM modules, case fan, and hard disk with SATA cable.  
  - See [project documentation](project_pc_build.md) for details and screenshot.  
- Completed Module 2 final quiz (85% accuracy)  

## Reflections
- Hands-on PC assembly reinforced understanding of how components work together.  
- Learned the importance of component order, proper CPU seating, and thermal paste application.  
- Confident in identifying hardware parts and explaining their functions.
