# Module 2 Notes: Computer Hardware

## Key Components
- **Motherboard**: Connects all components; contains CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Executes instructions; brain of the computer
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Fast, temporary storage used by active programs
- **Storage**: Permanent memory (HDD, SSD, NVMe)
- **Power Supply (PSU)**: Converts electricity to usable power for computer components
- **Peripherals**: External devices like keyboards, monitors, printers

## Memory Types
- **DRAM**: Dynamic RAM, requires refreshing, used as main system memory
- **SRAM**: Static RAM, faster, used in caches
- **DDR SDRAM**: Faster version of SDRAM, used in modern systems
- **DIMMs**: Dual Inline Memory Modules (RAM sticks)

## Chipsets
- **Northbridge**: Connects CPU to high-speed components (RAM, GPU)
- **Southbridge**: Manages slower devices (USB, storage, I/O)

## Storage Types
- **HDD**: Mechanical drive, uses spinning platters
- **SSD**: Solid state drive, faster and more reliable
- **NVMe**: High-speed interface for SSDs

## Glossary Highlights
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Firmware that initializes hardware and loads the OS
- **POST**: Power-On Self Test that checks hardware at startup
- **Cache**: Fast memory storing frequently accessed data
- **SATA**: Common interface for hard drives and SSDs
- **PCI Express**: Interface for graphics cards and expansion cards
- **Thermal Paste**: Improves heat transfer from CPU to heat sink
- **Heatsink/Fan**: Dissipates heat from CPU
- **Standoffs**: Small spacers used to mount the motherboard in the case
