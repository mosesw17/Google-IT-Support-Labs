# Module 2 Notes: Computer Hardware

## Key Components
- **Motherboard**: Main circuit board, holds CPU, RAM, expansion slots, chipset
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: "Brain" of the computer, processes instructions
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary, fast storage used by running programs
- **Storage**: Permanent data storage (HDDs, SSDs, NVMe drives)
- **Power Supply (PSU)**: Converts electricity into usable power for components
- **Peripherals**: External devices (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.)

## Memory Types
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: Needs constant refreshing, slower but cheaper
- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster, used in cache, more expensive
- **DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Modules)**: Sticks of RAM that plug into motherboard

## Chipsets
- **Northbridge**: Connects CPU to high-speed components (RAM, graphics card)
- **Southbridge**: Manages slower peripherals (USB, hard drives, I/O)

## Storage Types
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Magnetic storage, slower, cheaper
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Faster, uses flash memory
- **Flash Drives**: Portable solid-state storage

## Labs & Key Learnings
- Identified CPU sockets, RAM slots, PCIe slots on a motherboard diagram
- Compared performance differences between HDD and SSD
- Practiced matching glossary terms with hardware functions
