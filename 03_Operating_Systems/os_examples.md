# Operating System Examples

### Kernel vs User Space
- **Kernel Space**: Manages critical system operations like process scheduling, memory, and I/O.
- **User Space**: Where applications run and interact with the kernel through system calls.

### File Systems
- **NTFS**: Common on Windows.
- **HFS+/APFS**: Apple journaling file systems.
- **EXT4**: Widely used in Linux distributions.

### Boot Process
1. BIOS/UEFI checks hardware.
2. Bootloader loads the operating system.
3. Kernel initializes system processes.

### CLI vs GUI
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Access files/programs through typed commands.
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Navigate via icons, windows, and menus.

### Logs
- Used to backtrack issues and track system events.
- Example: Checking error logs to troubleshoot crashes.

### Booting Options
- Hard drive
- USB device (via install image, e.g., Etcher.io)
- CD/DVD

### Virtual Machines
- Run multiple OS on one machine.
- Useful for testing or running Linux inside Windows.
