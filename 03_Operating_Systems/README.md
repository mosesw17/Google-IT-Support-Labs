# Module 3: Operating Systems

This module explored the fundamental components and functions of an operating system.  
It focused on how OSs manage hardware, processes, files, and user interactions.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Kernel vs User Space**  
  - Kernel: The core of the OS, responsible for process management, memory, and hardware interaction.  
  - User Space: Where applications and user-level programs run, separated from the kernel for stability and security.  

- **Types of Operating Systems**  
  - **Windows**: Widely used, strong application ecosystem, GUI-based.  
  - **MacOS**: Appleâ€™s Unix-based OS, optimized for Apple hardware.  
  - **Linux**: Open-source, highly customizable, used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.  
  - **Chrome OS**: Linux-based, cloud-focused with lightweight performance.  

- **Files and File Systems**  
  - Structure of files and directories (folders).  
  - File extensions and handling.  
  - File systems (NTFS, HFS+/APFS, ext4, FAT32).  

- **Memory Management**  
  - RAM allocation and optimization.  
  - Virtual memory and swap space.  
  - Preventing hardware resource deficiency.  

- **Input/Output (I/O) Management**  
  - Manages data transfer between CPU, memory, and I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.).  

- **Logs and System Events**  
  - System logs track changes, errors, and events.  
  - Useful for troubleshooting and backtracking issues.  

- **Boot Process**  
  - BIOS/UEFI checks hardware readiness.  
  - Bootloader loads the OS.  
  - OS initializes kernel and starts services.  

- **Command Line vs GUI**  
  - GUI (Graphical User Interface): Visual, user-friendly interaction.  
  - CLI (Command Line Interface): Text-based, powerful for scripts and automation.  

- **Virtual Machines and Dual Booting**  
  - Run multiple OSs on the same machine.  
  - Boot from HDD, USB, or CD with install images.

## Glossary Highlights

- **Kernel**: Core part of the OS that manages hardware and processes.  
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Low-level software that initializes hardware before OS startup.  
- **Bootloader**: Small program that loads the operating system.  
- **File System**: The structure used to manage files (NTFS, ext4, etc.).  
- **Logs**: System files that record events and errors.  
- **I/O Management**: Controls how input and output devices interact with the system.  
- **Virtual Memory**: Technique of extending RAM using disk storage.

## Reflection

This module helped me understand **how operating systems connect hardware and software**, manage memory, and control system resources.  
It also showed the importance of logs for troubleshooting and gave me hands-on exposure to both **command line tools** and **system boot processes**.
