# Module 3 Notes: Operating Systems

## Key Concepts
- **Kernel**: Core of the OS that handles processes, memory, and I/O.
- **User Space**: Area where user applications run, separate from the kernel.
- **Memory Management**: Optimizes usage of physical and virtual memory.
- **I/O Management**: Controls input/output devices like keyboards, monitors, and hard drives.

## Boot Process
- BIOS/UEFI performs initial hardware checks.
- Bootloader launches the OS kernel.
- Kernel initializes and starts system processes.

## File Systems & Handling
- Organize and store files on disks.
- Support directories, extensions, and permissions.
- Different OS use different file systems.

## Logs
- System event records for troubleshooting.
- Help diagnose crashes, errors, and performance issues.

## OS Comparisons
- **Windows**: Widely used, GUI-focused, supports many apps.
- **Linux**: Open-source, customizable, many distributions.
- **Mac OS**: Apple’s proprietary OS, optimized for hardware.
- **Chrome OS**: Lightweight, cloud-based, Linux-based.

## Boot Methods
- From HDD/SSD
- From USB or CD
- Virtual machines enable multiple OS on the same computer.

- **Boot**: To start up a computer  
- **Bootloader**: A small program that loads the operating system  
- **Chrome OS**: A Linux-based operating system designed by Google  
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Text-based shell for interacting with the OS  
- **Computer file**: Any stored data, such as a document, picture, or program  
- **Data blocks**: Segments of data written across the hard disk  
- **Distributions**: Variants of Linux, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat
