- **Memory Management**: Optimizes usage of physical and virtual memory.
- **I/O Management**: Controls input/output devices like keyboards, monitors, and hard drives.

## Boot Process
- BIOS/UEFI performs initial hardware checks.
- Bootloader launches the OS kernel.
- Kernel initializes and starts system processes.

## File Systems & Handling
- Organize and store files on disks.
- Support directories, extensions, and permissions.
- Different OS use different file systems.

## Logs

## OS Comparisons
- **Windows**: Widely used, GUI-focused, supports many apps.
- **Linux**: Open-source, customizable, many distributions.
- **Mac OS**: Appleâ€™s proprietary OS, optimized for hardware.
- **Chrome OS**: Lightweight, cloud-based, Linux-based.
