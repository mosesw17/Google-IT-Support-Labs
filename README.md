# Google IT Support Professional Certificate Labs

This repository documents my journey through the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program.  
It includes hands-on lab exercises, notes, and reflections for each module to showcase technical growth.

## Repository Structure
- Each module has its own folder:
  - `README.md` → Overview & key concepts
  - `notes.md` → Detailed notes and exercises
  - Optional files (screenshots, scripts)
